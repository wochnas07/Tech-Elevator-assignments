-- Keys, Joins and Unions
--
-- Primary Key - a column or set of columns that uniquely identify a row in a table (Parent table)
-- Foreigh Key - a column or set of columns that match the primary key of another table (Dependent table)
--
-- Natural Key - Value(s) that exist for a table that can be used as primary keys
-- Surrogate Key - Artificially generated keys to use as a primary key
--
--  Joins are used when columns from multiple tables are required in a query
--
-- INNER JOIN - Matching rows between tables 
-- 
-- OUTER JOIN - All rows from both tables - the full set      
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- Inner Join syntax - 2 forms
-- 
--  SELECT columns
--    FROM table1, table2  
--  WHERE table1.column = table2.column  
--
-- If you omit join conditions the result is Cartersian Product
--    each from one table with each row in the other - IT'S NOT A JOIN
--
-- minimum # conditions on WHERE = # tables - 1
--
-- Modern syntax you CANNOT forget the join condition - its coded in ON clause
--
--  SELECT columns
--    FROM table1
--         INNER JOIN
--         table2
--      on table1.column = table2.column
--
-- Additional WHERE predicates may be added to either syntax to filter rows
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- -- OUTER JOIN syntax 
--
--  SELECT columns
--    FROM table1
--         FULL OUTER JOIN
--         table2
--      on table1.column = table2.column
--
-- Additional WHERE predicates may be added to either syntax to filter rows
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- UNION - Merging rows between two tables
--
-- Each SELECT must have the same number of columns in the same order and be compatible datatypes 
--      use literals if necessary to make the UNION work
--
-- SELECT columns
--   FROM table1
-- WHERE predicate
--
-- UNION
--
-- SELECT columns
--   FROM table2
-- WHERE predicate
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- UNION All - Concatenating rows between two tables
--
-- Each SELECT must have the same number of columns in the same order and be compatible datatypes 
--      use literals if necessary to make the UNION work
--
-- SELECT columns
--   FROM table1
-- WHERE predicate
--
-- UNION ALL
--
-- SELECT columns
--   FROM table2
-- WHERE predicate

-- ********* INNER JOIN ***********

-- Show the last_name of all the actors in the movie FINDING ANACONDA
--
--
-- last_name is in actor table
-- film title is in fim table
-- no direct link between actor and film
-- so we used the indirect link the film_actor table provided

SELECT  last_name
FROM    actor
        INNER JOIN
        film_actor
ON      actor.actor_id = film_actor.actor_id
        INNER JOIN
        film
ON      film_actor.film_id = film.film_id
WHERE   title = 'FINDING ANACONDA'
;


-- Let's find out who made payment 16666:

-- Ok, that gives us a customer_id, but not the name. We can use the customer_id to get the name FROM the customer table

-- We can see that the * pulls back everything from both tables. We just want everything from payment and then the first and last name of the customer:

-- But when did they return the rental? Where would that data come from? From the rental table, so let’s join that.

-- What did they rent? Film id can be gotten through inventory.

-- What if we wanted to know who acted in that film?

-- What if we wanted a list of all the films and their categories ordered by film title

-- Show all the 'Comedy' films ordered by film title

-- Finally, let's count the number of films under each category

-- ********* LEFT JOIN ***********

-- (There aren't any great examples of left joins in the "dvdstore" database, so the following queries are for the "world" database)

-- A Left join, selects all records from the "left" table and matches them with records from the "right" table if a matching record exists.

-- Let's display a list of all countries and their capitals, if they have some.

-- Only 232 rows
-- But we’re missing entries:

-- There are 239 countries. So how do we show them all even if they don’t have a capital?
-- That’s because if the rows don’t exist in both tables, we won’t show any information for it. If we want to show data FROM the left side table everytime, we can use a different join:

-- *********** UNION *************

-- Back to the "dvdstore" database...

-- Gathers a list of all first names used by actors and customers
-- By default removes duplicates

-- Gather the list, but this time note the source table with 'A' for actor and 'C' for customer
