# Project Organizer - Integration Testing

Create a Unit Test project for the **Project Organizer Database** application you created in the DAO Exercise.

Implement integration tests for the `JDBCDepartmentDAO`, `JDBCEmployeeDAO`, and `JDBCProjectDAO` classes.

Be sure to clean up any test data so that the database is returned to its original state after the test is completed.
